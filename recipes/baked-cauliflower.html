                This recipe is a vegetarian take on the classic Chinese dish, General Tso's Chicken.<br>
                The cauliflower is coated in a sticky and spicy glaze that is both sweet and savory. <br>
                It's a delicious and easy dish that is perfect for a weeknight meal.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 tsp. baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 large head of cauliflower (about 2½ lb.), cut into large florets</li>
            <li>¼ cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. mirin</li>
            <li>2 tsp. unseasoned rice vinegar</li>
            <li>Steamed rice, toasted sesame seeds, and thinly sliced scallions (for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 400°. Whisk flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl to combine. <br>
                Whisk in 1 cup water to create a thin pancake-like batter (you may need to add more water to achieve the right consistency). <br>
                Using your hand or 2 forks and working one at a time, dip cauliflower florets into batter, letting excess drip back into bowl, and divide <br>
                between 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake cauliflower until edges are just beginning to turn golden brown, 20–25 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, whisk gochujang, soy sauce, maple syrup, mirin, and 1 cup water in a medium bowl. <br>
                Pour sauce into a skillet large enough to hold all of the cauliflower florets (a 12" skillet should do it) and bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking occasionally. <br>
                Cook, whisking, until sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, 8–10 minutes. Stir in vinegar and remove pan from heat.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Using tongs, transfer cauliflower to skillet with glaze and toss until florets are evenly coated in sauce.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Divide rice among shallow bowls and spoon cauliflower over. Top with sesame seeds and scallions.
            </li>
        </ol>
