            <li>1 pound carrots - peeled and chopped into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 pounds baby red and/or gold potatoes - chopped into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>⅓ cup honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Arrange potatoes in a single layer on one third of a greased sheet pan, chicken on one third of the pan, and <br>
                carrots on the remaining third. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a medium sauce pan bring balsamic vinegar and honey to a boil. Cook for about 5 minutes until reduced by half, then remove <br>
                from heat and pour into a heat-safe bowl. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Drizzle oil over the potatoes, chicken, and carrots. Rub the oil over the chicken with your fingertips. Season potatoes, chicken and carrots <br>
                with salt and pepper to taste, garlic powder, basil, and thyme. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Spoon half of the balsamic sauce over the chicken. Sprinkle parmesan cheese over the potatoes. Bake for 20-25 minutes until chicken is <br>
                cooked through and carrots and potatoes are tender. Drizzle remaining balsamic sauce (it should be slightly thickened now after cooling) <br>
                over the chicken and carrots and serve. 
            </li>
        </ol>
